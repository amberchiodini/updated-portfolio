## Description: 
I created a portfolio using HTML, CSS, & JavaScript by following [Ania's Tutorial](https://github.com/kubowania/responsive-portfolio). It gave me a good starting point since I was unhappy with the portfolio that I created during coding bootcamp. Will be updating it with more features in the future!
